# Cache Simulator
Program that simulates different write-through cache configurations and evaluates memory trace files, then outputs the number of cache operations. Program includes Least Recently Used (LRU) AND First In First Out (FIFO) replacement policies. Simulator also includes a cache prefetcher.   

* Project uses C programming language.
* Running simulator interface: ./first <cache size(bytes)><associativity(power of 2)><cache policy(LRU or (FIFO)><block size(bytes)><memory trace file>


**Sample Cache Simulation with file of over a **MILLION** lines of memory accesses:**
* Cache Size: 32 bytes
* Associativity: 2-way
* Policy: First In First Out
